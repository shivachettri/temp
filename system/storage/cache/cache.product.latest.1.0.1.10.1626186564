Designed specifically for the creative professional, this display provides more space for easier access to all the tools and palettes needed to edit, format and composite your work.

Unlike other flat panels, it's designed with a pure digital interface to deliver distortion-free images that never need adjusting. With over 4 million digital pixels, the display is uniquely suited for scientific and technical applications such as visualizing molecular structures or analyzing geological data. &lt;br&gt;\r\n\t&lt;br&gt;\r\n\t&lt;\/font&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;Helvetica&quot; size=&quot;2&quot;&gt;Offering accurate, brilliant color performance, the Cinema HD delivers up to 16.7 million colors across a wide gamut allowing you to see subtle nuances between colors from soft pastels to rich jewel tones. A wide viewing angle ensures uniform color from edge to edge. Apple's ColorSync technology allows you to create custom profiles to maintain consistent color onscreen and in print.

Taking advantage of the much thinner and lighter footprint of an LCD, the new displays support the VESA (Video Electronics Standards Association) mounting interface standard.
